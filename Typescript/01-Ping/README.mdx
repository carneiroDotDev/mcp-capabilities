# Ping

Let's get our MCP server running. The TypeScript SDK for MCP supports `ping`
out of the box, so all we need to do is initialize the server, set up a
transport for it, and then it should respond to `ping` requests.

## Note

When initializing your MCP server, you'll need to provide `name` and
`version` fields. The `name` is a human-readable identifier for your server
(for example, `MyProductName`), and the `version` indicates the version of
your server (such as `1.0.0`). These fields help clients and tools identify
and interact with your server correctly, and are required by the MCP
specification.

## Getting Started

Start in `src/index.ts` and follow the instructions in the comments.
